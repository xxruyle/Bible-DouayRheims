# Bible JSON - Douay Rheims Translation
 All 73 books of the Douay Rheims Bible in JSON format.  

# How do I access it?
- `Douay-Rheims` folder contains all 73 individual books in JSON format as well as a singular file which contains all the books (`EntireBible-DR.json`)


# How it was made 
1) Converted the Douay Rheims Bible into a txt file (`dr_bible.txt`)
2) Parsed the dr_bible.txt file using python `main.py`
3) I am unable to check and make sure every verse is identical to the real thing, so of course there may be some mistakes. In the meantime I will try to fix any issues that I can find.
