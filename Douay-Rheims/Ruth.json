  "1": "In the *days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.",
  "2": "He was named Elimelech, and his wife, Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. And entering into the country of Moab, they abode there.",
  "3": "And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons.",
  "4": "And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt there ten years,",
  "5": "And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.",
  "6": "And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with both her daughters-in-law: for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people, and had given them food.",
  "7": "Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters-in-law: and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda,",
  "8": "She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.",
  "9": "May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands which you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep,",
  "10": "And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.",
  "11": "But she answered them: Return, my daughters, why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?",
  "12": "Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children,",
  "13": "If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man's estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.",
  "14": "And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother-in-law.",
  "15": "And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou with her.",
  "16": "She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.",
  "17": "The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I be buried. The Lord do so and so to me, and add more also, if ought but death part me and thee.",
  "18": "Then Noemi, seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends:",
  "19": "So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the women said: This is that Noemi.",
  "20": "But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful), but call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness.",
  "21": "I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath afflicted?",
  "22": "So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the beginning of the barley harvest."

  "44": "Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.",
  "45": "And Booz, taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.",
  "46": "They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of Moab, will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.",
  "47": "I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it: But if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.",
  "48": "And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman's hand, thou must take also Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of the deceased: to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance.",
  "49": "He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego.",
  "50": "*Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe, and gave it to his neighhour; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.",
  "51": "So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took it off from his foot.",
  "52": "And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and Chelion's, and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi:",
  "53": "And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance, lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren, and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.",
  "54": "Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in Bethlehem:",
  "55": "And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, *whom Thamar bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.",
  "56": "Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.",
  "57": "And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be preserved in Israel.",
  "58": "And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter-in-law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.",
  "59": "And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.",
  "60": "And the women, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and saying: There is a son born to Noemi, called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.",
  "61": "These are the generations of Phares: *Phares begot Esron,",
  "62": "Esron begot Aram, Aram begot Aminadab,",
  "63": "Aminadab begot Nahasson, Nahasson begot Salmon,",
  "64": "Salmon begot Booz, Booz begot Obed,",
  "65": "Obed begot Isai, Isai begot David."
