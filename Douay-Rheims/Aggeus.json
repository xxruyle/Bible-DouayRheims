   "102": "Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.",
   "103": "And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath-day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath-day.",

   "110": "*Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin in this kind of thing? and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel:** and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.",

   "112": "And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliasib, the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanaballat, the Horonite, and I drove him from me.",
   "113": "Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.",
   "114": "So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry:",
